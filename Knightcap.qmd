Knight Cap came to us in the early stages of their journey, with a vision but no clear direction. Our job? Crafting a cohesive identity that could live across their restaurant, merchandise, and digital presence.

## Overview

Knight Cap is more than a name—it’s now a fully realized experience, carefully crafted from concept to execution.

## Our Approach

- **Logo Development** – We collaborated with the team to create a bold, recognizable logo that reflects the brand’s personality and fits seamlessly into the restaurant’s atmosphere.  
- **Merchandise That Resonates** – Beyond aesthetics, we designed wearable, high-quality merchandise that felt on-brand and desirable for their audience.  
- **Full Branding Execution** – From merchandise designs to in-store graphics, we ensured every touchpoint within the restaurant carried the same strong visual identity.

## Results

- Complete visual identity from logo to merch  
- Brand cohesion across physical and digital spaces  
- Merchandise that aligns with Knight Cap’s culture and customer experience
