## About Me

I'm **Joshua Arias**, a digital marketer, creative strategist, and entrepreneur based in Los Angeles.\
I’m passionate about building brands that move culture — blending streetwear, marketing, and digital innovation into everything I do.

Currently finishing my **Master’s in Digital Marketing** at **Cal Poly Pomona**, while scaling multiple apparel brands and growing a creative consulting firm.

This site showcases a few of the tools and frameworks I use to bring ideas to life — built with Quarto, R, and a whole lot of caffeine.
